Pycombinator - Y Combinator implementation in python


This is a step-by-step implementation of the Y Combinator - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_combinator -  function in python using test-driven development.

Basically, following the same reasoning from the book "the little schemer", pages 160-173.

(maybe my implementation is a little bit too LISPy, but that's the way it is in the book :-)
